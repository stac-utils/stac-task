# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [unreleased]

## Deprecated

- Support for Python 3.8 has been removed.
- CLI flags `--skip-upload` and `--skip-validation` deprecated in favor of `--upload/--no-upload` and `--validate/no-validate`
- Task constructor arguments `skip_upload` and `skip_validation` deprecated in favor of `upload` and `validate`

## Fixed

- Several CLI arguments were missing `help` descriptions

## Changed

- `--local` flag no longer turns off validation
- The `processing:software` field is no longer added to Items by default. This is
  because the intention of the STAC Processing Extension is to add metadata about the
  processing of the data, whereas stactask is frequently used only for processing
  metadata. Users wishing to retain this field can call the method `Task.add_software_version_to_item(item)` on the resulting item to add it.
- Task logging now identifies the task instance that is logging, e.g.,
  `INFO:my-task-name:[my-collection/workflow-my-workflow/task-1] Task did a thing.`
- Collection assignment now assigns the first matching collection expression, rather
  than the last.

## Added

- Property `collection_mapping` to `Task` class to retrieve the collection mappings
  from upload_options
- Utils method `find_collection` to allow the retrieval of the collection name for
  an Item dict
- Task method `upload_local_item_assets_to_s3(item)` to upload all local assets to S3
- Added support for using stdin and stdout as input and output for task, e.g., `cat in.json | src/mytask/mytask.py run --local | tee out.json`

## [v0.4.2] - 2024-03-08

### Added

- ([#92](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/92)) Task.upload_item_assets_to_s3 and asset_io.upload_item_assets_to_s3 support explicitly specifying the boto3utils3.s3 object.

## [v0.4.1] - 2024-03-06

### Fixed

- ([#90](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/90)) Block asset_io
  module from reaching out to upstream stac APIs (especially on NASA Wednesdays
  `transform_hrefs=False`)

## [v0.4.0] - 2024-02-14

### Fixed

- ([#86](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/86)) Guard cleanup of workdir to ensure task was actually created.

### Added

- ([#72](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/72)) Given that `_get_file` is part of the `AsyncFileSystem` spec, this
  adds the synchronous `get_file` as a way to retrieve files if `_get_file` is
  not found.
- ([#77](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/77)) Added option `keep_original_filenames` to download routines to
  support legacy applications dependent on filename specifics.

## [v0.3.0] - 2023-12-20

### Changed

- handler now explicitly calls performs workdir cleanup
- workdir cleanup is correctly defensive and logs errors

## [v0.2.0] - 2023-11-16

### Changed

- Ensure `workdir` is an absolute path
  ([#54](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/51)).
- When a `workdir` is set for a `Task` the `workdir` will no longer be removed
  by default ([#51](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/51)). That is,
  the `save_workdir` argument to `Task` constructor now defaults to `None`, and
  if left as `None` the default behavior is now conditional on whether or not a
      `workdir` is specified.

  - If `workdir` is `None`, a temp directory will be created and `save_workdir`
    will default to `False` (remove working directory).
  - If a `workdir` is specified, then `save_workdir` will default to `True`
    (keep working directory).

  In either case, an explicit `True` or `False` value for `save_workdir` will
  take precedence.

## [v0.1.1] - 2023-07-12

### Fixed

- Typing ([#11](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/11), [#25](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/25))
- Removed console scripts ([#18](https://github.com/stac-utils/stac-task/pull/18))

## [v0.1.0] - 2022-10-31

Initial release.
